# Welcome to my Github portfolio 
# 2016 Internship History

## What is this?

The work here is a representation of what I was able of too build after 2 years of university schooling. I was part of a small team - Myself, another developer and a tester. 

The aim of the internship was to give soon to be grads a taste of what building enterprise software looks like (this is not what it looks like), due to the constraints of time, we couldn't build it out to be a full-fledged enterprise software. 


## Why does this matter

 What we ended up building is a simple billing application that reads data from a database (built already for us) and spits out a CSV/Excel document based on user input. **This application fulfilled that goal to a satisfying degree**

 **Reading the code you will see a novice developer coming into their own**. If you choose to investigate longer you will see the gradual progress of how my code changed over [2018](https://github.com/Lwachira/2018-Work-History), [2019](https://github.com/Lwachira/2019-Work-History), [2020](https://github.com/Lwachira/2020-Work-History).
